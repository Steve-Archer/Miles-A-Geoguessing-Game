Miles A Geoguessing Game is a ten round game of guessing in miles the distance between two US cities.

Your score is determined by the difference(higher or lower) of your guess and the actual answer.
You only have ten seconds and what you have in the guessbox is your guess.

It's a simple name/password registration. The user's name is saved along with their personal best (low) score.
At the end of ten rounds, click the End Game button to proceed to the top10 overall best (low) scores.

My anti-cheat disclaimer is to ask you to not cheat. Its a simple little game. Thank you!
